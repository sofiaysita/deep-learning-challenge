Overview:

Create a binary classifier that can predict whether applicants will be successful if funded by Alphabet Soup.

Results:

Data Preprocessing:
- Used Pandas to read Charity Data csv
- Dropped unnecessary columns
- Determined unique values for columns >10 values
- Picked a cutoff point to bin 
- Used  Panda's "get_dummies()" to encode categorical variables.
- Split data into training and testing datasets.
- Scaled the training and testing features

Compiling, Training, and Evaluating the Model:
- Used 2 layers: 9 and 18 neurons with "relu" and 100 epochs

Summary:

With the first model I achieved an accuracy of 73%.

After optimization I achieved an accuracy of 73.23%
